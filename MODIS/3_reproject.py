# You can use the gdal library in Python to reproject a MODIS image to a 
# different Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The process involves first 
# reading the image using the gdal.Open() function, then create a new image 
# with the desired CRS using the gdal.Warp() function.
# Here's an example of how to do this:

from osgeo import gdal

# Open the original image
src_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/original_image.tif")

# Get the original image's projection
src_proj = src_ds.GetProjection()

# Create a new image with the desired CRS (EPSG:4326)
dst_ds = gdal.Warp('path/to/reprojected_image.tif', src_ds, dstSRS='EPSG:4326')

# Close the datasets
src_ds = None
dst_ds = None
# This script will use the gdal.Warp() function to create a new image called 
# "reprojected_image.tif" that has been reprojected to the EPSG:4326 CRS. The 
# dstSRS parameter is used to set the target CRS.
# The function will use the nearest neighbor resampling method to resample the 
# image, you can use other resampling method such as 'cubic', 'bilinear' etc by 
# passing the parameter 'resampleAlg' to the function.

# Please keep in mind that reprojecting an image to a different CRS will change 
# the coordinates of the image, but it will not change the resolution of the image, 
# so the number of pixels will remain the same.
# Also, keep in mind that the image should have a valid projection information, 
# otherwise the script will raise an error.
