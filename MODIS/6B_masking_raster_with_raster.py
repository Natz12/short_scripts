There are different ways to use a raster mask to mask another raster, but one 
common approach is to use the gdal library in Python. Here is an example of how 
to do this:

from osgeo import gdal

# Open the original raster
src_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/original_raster.tif")
src_band = src_ds.GetRasterBand(1)

# Open the mask raster
mask_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/mask_raster.tif")
mask_band = mask_ds.GetRasterBand(1)

# create the output raster
driver = gdal.GetDriverByName("GTiff")
dst_ds = driver.Create("path/to/output_raster.tif",src_ds.RasterXSize,src_ds.RasterYSize,1,gdal.GDT_Float32)

# set the output raster's projection and geotransform
dst_ds.SetProjection(src_ds.GetProjection())
dst_ds.SetGeoTransform(src_ds.GetGeoTransform())

# get the data from the original raster
src_data = src_band.ReadAsArray()

#get the data from the mask raster
mask_data = mask_band.ReadAsArray()

# use the mask to create the output raster
output_data = src_data * mask_data

# write the output data to the output raster
dst_ds.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(output_data)

# close the datasets
src_ds = None
mask_ds = None
dst_ds = None


# This script will use the `gdal.Open()` function to open the original raster and 
# the mask raster, it will use the `GetRasterBand()` function to get the first band 
# of each image. Then, it will create an output raster using the `gdal.GetDriverByName()` 
# and `Create()` functions. The output raster will have the same size, projection 
# and geotransform as the original raster.

# It will use the `ReadAsArray()` function to get the data from the original raster 
# and the mask raster, it will use the `*` operator to apply the mask to the original 
# aster. The output raster will have the same values as the original raster where 
# the mask is 1 and 0 where the mask is 0.

# Finally, it will use the `WriteArray()` function to write the output data to the 
# output raster, and close the datasets using the `None` assignment.

# Please note that this script assumes that the original raster and the mask raster 
# have the same size and that the mask raster only contains 0s and 1s. If the rasters 
# have different sizes or the mask raster contains other values, it will be necessary 
# to perform some additional processing. You may also need to check that the rasters 
# are in the same CRS, otherwise, you will need to reproject one of them to match the other before applying the mask.



# If the original raster and the mask raster have different sizes, additional 
# processing is needed in order to match the sizes of the rasters before applying the mask.
# Here are a few options to achieve this:

# Resampling: One option is to use the gdal.Warp() function to resample the 
# original raster or the mask raster to match the size of the other raster. 
# The gdal.Warp() function allows you to specify the target size and resolution of 
# the output raster.

# Cropping: Another option is to use the gdal.Translate() function to crop the 
# original raster or the mask raster to match the size of the other raster. 
# The gdal.Translate() function allows you to specify the target size of the 
# output raster by providing the x-offset, y-offset, x-size, and y-size of the output raster.

# Padding: Another option is to use the numpy library to pad the original raster 
# or the mask raster with zeros to match the size of the other raster. You can 
# use the numpy.pad() function to do this.

# Keep in mind that resampling or cropping the rasters can affect the accuracy of 
# the results, especially if the rasters have different resolutions, so it's 
# important to choose the appropriate method based on the specific requirements of your analysis.
