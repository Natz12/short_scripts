# If the two rasters are not aligned, you will need to resample and/or 
# reproject one of the rasters to match the other before using the mask. 
# Here's an example of how to use the gdal.Warp() function to resample and 
# reproject the original raster to match the mask raster using gdal library in Python:

from osgeo import gdal

# Open the original raster
src_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/original_raster.tif")

# Open the mask raster
mask_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/mask_raster.tif")

# Get the spatial reference of the mask raster
mask_srs = mask_ds.GetProjection()

# Get the size of the mask raster
mask_xsize = mask_ds.RasterXSize
mask_ysize = mask_ds.RasterYSize

# Create the output raster
dst_ds = gdal.Warp("path/to/output_raster.tif", src_ds, format = 'GTiff', dstSRS = mask_srs, xRes = mask_xsize, yRes = mask_ysize)

# Close the datasets
src_ds = None
mask_ds = None
dst_ds = None
# This script will use the gdal.Open() function to open the original raster and 
# the mask raster, it will use the GetProjection() method to get the spatial 
# reference of the mask raster and RasterXSize and RasterYSize properties to
# get the size of the mask raster. Then, it will use the gdal.Warp() function 
# to resample and reproject the original raster to match the mask raster. The 
# gdal.Warp() function allows you to specify the target spatial reference (dstSRS) 
# and the target resolution (xRes and yRes) of the output raster.

# Once you have the two rasters aligned, you can use the mask to mask the 
# original raster.
# Here's an example of how to use the numpy library to apply the mask to the original raster:

Copy code
import numpy as np

# Open the original raster
src_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/original_raster.tif")
original_raster = src_ds.ReadAsArray()

# Open the mask raster
mask_ds = gdal.Open("path/to/mask_raster.tif")
mask_raster = mask_ds.ReadAsArray()

# Apply the mask
output_raster = np.where(mask_raster == 1, original_raster, np.nan)
# This script will use the gdal.Open() function to open the original raster and 
# the mask raster, it will use the ReadAsArray() method to read the rasters into 
# numpy arrays. Then, it will use the np.where() function to create a new array 
# where all the pixels of the original raster that correspond to a value of 1 in 
# the mask raster are kept, and all other pixels are set to NaN.

# You can then use the gdal.GetDriverByName() and Create() functions to write the 
# output raster to a new file.



# is it correct to set the xRes = mask_xsize? One is talking about resolution 
# and the other about sizes


# You are correct, xRes should represent the resolution and not the size. The 
# xRes and yRes parameters of the gdal.Warp() function indicate the desired 
# resolution of the output raster in the x and y directions, respectively. The 
# resolution is usually specified in units of length per pixel (e.g., meters per 
# pixel) and not in pixels.
# To get the resolution of the mask_raster you can use the GetGeoTransform() 
# method that returns the geotransform of the image. The geotransform is a 
# 6-element tuple containing the following information:

# The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the image
# The x-resolution (i.e., the width of a pixel in the x-direction)
# The x-skew (i.e., the rotation of the image in the x-y plane)
# The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the image
# The y-skew (i.e., the rotation of the image in the x-y plane)
# The y-resolution (i.e., the height of a pixel in the y-direction)
# You can use the second and sixth elements of the geotransform to get the xRes 
# and yRes values of the image.


xRes = abs(mask_ds.GetGeoTransform()[1])
yRes = abs(mask_ds.GetGeoTransform()[5])
# Then you can use the xRes and yRes values in the gdal.Warp function.


dst_ds = gdal.Warp("path/to/output_raster.tif", src_ds, format = 'GTiff', dstSRS = mask_srs, xRes = xRes, yRes = yRes)
